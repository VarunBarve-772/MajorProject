    like placing bid and adding the auction to watchlist requires the user to first login.

    server side validation is done. (client side validation is done using HTML5 tags and server side validation
    is done in python)

    watchlist, place bid on listings, create new listing and check if they won any of the closed listings.
R:  Users can directly search for an auction from the navbar, The search query matches the title or category
    of the ongoing auctions and returns the result.

    otherwise tthe bid won't be placed. Once the auction is closed the user with the highest bid wins and can 
    contact the owner of the listing for furthur process, all the necessary details will be provided.
